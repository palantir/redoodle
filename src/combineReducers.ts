 * Turns an object whose values are different reducer functions into a single

 * into a single state object, whose keys correspond to the keys of the passed
 * reducer functions.
 *
 * Remark: This function behaves almost the same as the redux builtin combineReducers,
 * except this version does not perform any initial undefined-state shape computation.
 * For more on initial state handling, consult the discussion in initialState.md.
 *
 * @template S Combined state object type.
 *
 * @param reducerMap An object whose values correspond to different reducer
 *   functions that need to be combined into one.
 *
 * @returns A reducer function that invokes every reducer inside the passed
 *   object, and builds a state object with the same shape.
